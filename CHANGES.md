 * SpecificVersion set to False in order not to be dependent on a version of Elasticsearch or Serilog.

3.0.121
 * protected virtual ElasticsearchResponse<T> EmitBatchChecked<T>(IEnumerable<LogEvent> events) function now uses a generic type. This allows you to map to either DynamicResponse or to BulkResponse if you want to use NEST.
 
3.0.112
 * Added exponential backoff strategy when unable to send data to Elasticsearch when using the durable sink option.

3.0.98

 * Fixed typo: ModifyConnectionSetttings to ModifyConnectionSettings.

2.0.42
